# Arkanoid-Final
Final Arkanoid Project - OOP

## About:
This is the final product of our Arkanoid game. We added a main menu, the ability to read the level definitons in from files and a highscores table.
We practiced using Java generics, as well as re-organize some of our code to remove code duplication using object composition and the decorator design patterns.
